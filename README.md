# linux-shell
my own implementation of linux shell performing basic operations in C

Supported operations:
1. Execution of basic linux shell command like mkdir, cd, rmdir, ls and all other built in commands.
2. Run processes in background or foreground with the help of & operator.
3. Piping of input/output (e.g: "ls | grep file")
4. Input and Output Redirection to/from an external file using ">>, <, >" operators.
5. Demonstrates the use of fork() system call.
